## Our values

We are building Wanderers of the Rift and Builders of the Rift as a community driven, open source project rooted in trust, creativity, and shared purpose. 
These values guide how we collaborate and what we’re creating together:

### Open source
Both mods are licensed under AGPL-3.0, ensuring that the source code remains freely available, forkable, and open to the public.

### Accessibility
We are committed to including accessibility features wherever possible so that a wide range of players can enjoy the mod.

### Play your own way
We believe players should be free to express themselves through gameplay. 
Our design avoids forcing specific styles or solutions and instead encourages creativity and exploration.

## How we build

### Open idea contribution
Anyone in the project can share ideas through our forums and channels. 
We’re working to make the contribution process more streamlined and inclusive over time.

### Distributed leadership
We operate through shared leadership among core contributors who share direction and decision making responsibilities. 
Gameplay and content decisions are guided by the coordination team and community while organizational processes are led by the elected/appointed leadership team. 
While leadership defines key processes, contributor feedback is always welcome and encouraged.

### Transparency
We value transparency as a foundation for trust. 
This includes openness around decisions, development progress, and financial matters, while still respecting privacy, boundaries, and project roles



# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless
of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

2. Embrace diversity and inclusion
- Respect differing perspectives, experiences, and identities.

- Use inclusive language and behavior.

- Avoid publishing others' private information without consent.


## AI
The standard for our project will be to utilize the work of the artists and creators on our team rather than relying on AI for these creative works. 

We trust our team members who utilize AI will do so in a way that complements their original work and not use it as a final product so we can avoid copyright issues. 
Assets discovered to be purely Generative AI will result in the replacement of the asset. 
We reserve the right as a team to determine whether an asset is the work of AI and call for a replacement. 

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The Project Leadership (PL) and Moderation team is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

The PL and Moderation team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not limited to Discord, Github, Build/Test servers, and Reddit.

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. 

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the PM team using the reporting form provided in the discord. 
The PL and Moderation team will review and investigate all complaints promptly, fairly, and with discretion.

All members of the PL and Moderation team are committed to respecting the privacy and safety of anyone who reports an incident. 
Retaliation against reporters will not be tolerated.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The PL and Moderation team will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

of actions.

**Consequence:** A formal warning issued by the PL and Moderation team. The individual may be temporarily restricted from certain channels or forums.

sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
